        "Orthogonal symmetries, also known as reflections, are key isometries defined within a vector space E, which is decomposed into subspaces F and G forming a direct sum. Projections PF and PG map vectors from E to F and G respectively, ensuring every vector u in E can be uniquely represented as u = v + w, where v belongs to F and w belongs to G. These projections are linear maps satisfying properties like PF\u00b2 = PF, PG\u00b2 = PG, and PF + PG = id, essential for understanding symmetries. The symmetry (or reflection) with respect to F and parallel to G in vector space E is a linear map s that transforms vectors based on their projections onto subspaces F and G, defined such that s(u) = 2pF(u) - u, where E is the direct sum of F and G. This transformation reflects vectors across F while keeping F invariant and reversing the components in G, with the property s\u00b2 = id, indicating s is the identity on F and -id on G.",
        "In a Euclidean space E, orthogonal symmetry (or reflection) with respect to orthogonal subspaces F and G, where F = G^\u22a5, is a linear map s: E \u2192 E such that s(u) = 2pF(u) - u = pF(u) - pG(u) for every u in E. When F is a hyperplane, s is termed a hyperplane symmetry or reflection about F; when G is a plane, s is a flip about F (dim(F) = n - 2). This symmetry preserves distances, making it an isometry, and its matrix representation simplifies given an orthonormal basis. For a hyperplane H, the symmetry s is an improper orthogonal transformation. When F = {0}, s = -id, representing symmetry with respect to the origin. If G is a plane, a flip about F is a rotation. Given orthogonal subspaces F, G forming a direct sum, the symmetries f and g with respect to F and G satisfy f \u2218 g = g \u2218 f = -id.",
        "For any vectors u, v \u2208 E, the inner product satisfies ||u + v||\u00b2 - ||u - v||\u00b2 = 4(u \u00b7 v), and if u and v are orthogonal, then ||u + v|| = ||u - v||. Given an orthonormal basis of E consisting of orthonormal bases of F and G, the symmetry s has a matrix representation with In (identity matrix of size p) and -In-p (negative identity matrix of size n-p) on the diagonal. Thus, det(s) = (-1)^(n-p), determining whether s is a rotation or an improper orthogonal transformation. The symmetry s is an isometry, preserving the norm of vectors, i.e., ||s(u)|| = ||u||. With respect to an orthonormal basis of E consisting of orthonormal bases of F and G, the matrix of s has the form with In and In-p being identity matrices of size p and n-p, respectively, where p is the dimension of F and n-p is the dimension of G.",
        "Hyperplane reflections, represented by Householder matrices, are fundamental in numerical matrix analysis for solving linear equations, least squares problems, eigenvalue computations, and symmetric matrix transformations. A reflection s about a hyperplane H, given a nonnull vector w orthogonal to H, transforms any vector u in E as s(u) = u - 2((u\u00b7w)/||w||\u00b2)w, preserving vector norms and acting as an isometry. These reflections are key to decomposing matrices and understanding geometric transformations. For a hyperplane H with a nonnull vector w orthogonal to H, the explicit formula for s(u) is s(u) = u - 2((u \u00b7 w) / ||w||\u00b2)w, where w defines the orientation of the reflection. Given any nonnull vector w orthogonal to a hyperplane H, the hyperplane reflection s about H is given by s(u) = u - 2((u\u00b7w)/||w||^2)w.",
        "Householder matrices, expressed as H = In - 2(WW^T)/||W||\u00b2, where W is a nonzero vector in R^n, are symmetric and orthogonal, playing a crucial role in representing hyperplane reflections over an orthonormal basis. These matrices are used to derive formulas for rotations in R\u00b3, facilitating transformations based on the direction of the rotation axis and the rotation angle, and are central to the QR-decomposition of matrices. A Householder matrix is defined as H = In - 2(WW^T) / ||W||\u00b2, where W \u2208 R^n is a nonzero vector. A Householder matrix is a matrix of the form H = In - 2(WW^T)/||W||^2, where W is a nonzero vector in R^n.  Householder matrices are symmetric and orthogonal, and they represent hyperplane reflections. Householder matrices, representing hyperplane reflections, have the form H = In - 2(WW\u1d40 / ||W||\u00b2), where W is a nonzero vector in R\u207f. These matrices are symmetric and orthogonal, playing a key role in numerical matrix analysis.",
        "Given two vectors u, v \u2208 E with ||u|| = ||v||, there exists a hyperplane H such that the reflection s about H maps u to v. If u \u2260 v, then H = {v - u}\u22a5, and s(u) = v. This reflection is unique if u \u2260 v. For any two vectors u, v \u2208 E with ||u|| = ||v||, there exists a hyperplane H such that the reflection s about H maps u to v.  If u \u2260 v, this reflection is unique and H = {v - u}^\u22a5."

        "The QR-decomposition, achieved through Householder matrices, geometrically transforms an orthonormal basis (e1, ..., en) to a new set of vectors (v1, ..., vn) via a sequence of hyperplane reflections h1, ..., hn.

The matrix R, whose columns are the components of rj over the basis (e1,..., en), is an upper triangular matrix. The hi can be chosen such that the diagonal entries of R are nonnegative. This process provides a QR-decomposition of a matrix using Householder transformations.",
        "The QR-decomposition of a real n \u00d7 n matrix A involves finding Householder matrices H1, ..., Hn and an upper triangular matrix R such that R = Hn ... H1A, where each Hi is either a Householder matrix or the identity. For a real n \u00d7 n matrix A, there exists a sequence of Householder matrices (or the identity) H1,..., Hn and an upper triangular matrix R such that R = Hn...H2H1A. As a result, A can be decomposed into A = QR, where Q is an orthogonal matrix and R is an upper triangular matrix with nonnegative diagonal entries. This decomposition allows expressing A as A = QR, where Q is an orthogonal matrix formed by the product of the Householder matrices, enabling efficient computation and analysis of matrix properties.",
        "For a nontrivial Euclidean space E of dimension n with an orthonormal basis (e1,..., en), there exists a sequence of n isometries h1, ..., hn, where each hi is a hyperplane reflection or the identity.

        "The QR-decomposition is achieved through a sequence of Householder matrices H1, ..., Hn such that R = Hn \u2218 ... \u2218 H2H1A. The determinant of A can be computed as det(A) = (-1)^m r1,1 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 rn,n, where m is the number of Householder matrices (excluding the identity). The method can be interpreted as computing a sequence of matrices A1, ..., An+1 = R, where Ak+1 = Hk \u2218 ... \u2218 H2H1A. The (k + 1)th column of Ak+1 is transformed by Hk+1 to zero all entries below the (k + 1)th entry. If negative diagonal entries are allowed in R, the last isometry Hn may be omitted. Remarks on the QR-decomposition using Householder matrices include the fact that since each Hi is a hyperplane reflection or the identity, their composition \u03c1 is an isometry, and if negative diagonal entries are allowed in R, the last isometry Hn may be omitted. The method also computes the determinant of A as det(A) = (-1)^m r1,1 ... rn,n, where m is the number of Householder matrices used, and preserves the condition number of the matrix A, ensuring numerical stability."
