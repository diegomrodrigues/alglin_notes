        "A Hermitian form \\u03c6: E \\u00d7 E \\u2192 C is a sesquilinear form that satisfies \\u03c6(v, u) = \\u03c6(u, v) for all u, v \\u2208 E, exhibiting a conjugate symmetry. This implies that \\u03c6(u, u) is always a real number. Hermitian forms generalize the notion of symmetric bilinear forms from real vector spaces to complex vector spaces, ensuring that the inner product-like structure is well-behaved with respect to complex conjugation. They are also fundamental in quantum mechanics.",

The quadratic form captures essential properties of the sesquilinear form and is particularly useful in characterizing positive definiteness. Polarization identities relate the sesquilinear form with the associated quadratic form, allowing one to express \\u03c6(u, v) in terms of values of the quadratic form.

A complex vector space E equipped with a Hermitian form \\u03c6 that is positive is called a pre-Hilbert space. This structure provides a notion of 'inner product' that allows for defining lengths and angles, but does not guarantee completeness. If the Hermitian form \\u03c6 on E is positive definite, then E is called a Hermitian space (or unitary space). Positive definiteness ensures that the 'inner product' induces a norm, making the space suitable for geometric and analytical considerations, as well as spectral theorems and eigenvalue analysis.",

This norm provides a measure of the 'length' or 'magnitude' of a vector in the Hermitian space and satisfies properties such as non-negativity, homogeneity, and the triangle inequality. The quantity \\u03c6(u, v) is usually called the Hermitian product of u and v, representing a complex-valued inner product that generalizes the real-valued dot product. It is linear in the first argument and semilinear in the second, capturing the interplay between linearity and complex conjugation.",

The Gram matrix is Hermitian positive definite and encapsulates the inner product structure with respect to the chosen basis, facilitating computations and transformations. If A is a Hermitian positive definite matrix, (x,y) = y*Ax is a Hermitian product on E.
