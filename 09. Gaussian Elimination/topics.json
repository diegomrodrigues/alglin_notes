        "Gaussian elimination is a method for solving linear systems by transforming a matrix into an upper-triangular form through row operations. These operations include adding or subtracting multiples of rows and potentially permuting rows to ensure the method works in all cases. The key idea is to iteratively eliminate variables using these row operations to obtain an upper-triangular matrix, simplifying the system for back-substitution and solution finding. The method can be applied to a linear system Ax = b, where A is assumed to be invertible, using a variable k to keep track of the stages of elimination, initially setting k = 1.",
        "Pivoting is a crucial step in Gaussian elimination where rows are permuted to avoid zero or very small pivot elements, which can cause numerical instability. The element chosen as the pivot is used to eliminate variables in other rows. The process involves iteratively selecting a pivot, permuting rows to position the pivot, and eliminating variables by adding multiples of the pivot row to other rows, continuing until the matrix is in upper-triangular form.",

        "Elementary matrices represent row operations and can be used to perform Gaussian elimination. Multiplying a matrix by an elementary matrix on the left performs a row operation, while multiplying on the right performs column operations. Transposition matrices permute rows, denoted as P(i,k), are used to permute the kth row with the ith row, and are symmetric and their own inverse. Elementary matrices of the form Ei,j;\\u03b2 are used to add \\u03b2 times row j to row i and are used to eliminate variables during Gaussian elimination.",

        "The existence of an LU-factorization depends on the invertibility of leading principal submatrices. A matrix A has an LU-factorization if and only if all leading principal submatrices A(1:k, 1:k) are invertible for k = 1, ..., n, ensuring that Gaussian elimination can proceed without row interchanges. The pivots obtained during Gaussian elimination are related to the determinants of the leading principal submatrices and are used to determine the matrices L and U.",

Nonpivot variables, also known as free variables, can be assigned arbitrary values, and pivot variables can be expressed in terms of nonpivot variables.
