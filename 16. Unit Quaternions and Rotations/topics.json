        "Unit quaternions are elements of the group SU(2), represented by 2x2 complex matrices of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & \\beta \\\\ -\\overline{\\beta} & \\overline{\\alpha} \\end{pmatrix}$ where $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{C}$ and $|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1$. They form a real vector space denoted as H = R \u22c2 SU(2).  They provide a way to express rotations in 3D space.",
        "Quaternions can be expressed as $X = a1 + bi + cj + dk$, where $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and 1, i, j, k are quaternion units. These units satisfy Hamilton's identities: $i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = ijk = -1$, $ij = -ji = k$, $jk = -kj = i$, and $ki = -ik = j$. Quaternion multiplication is non-commutative. Quaternions form a skew field denoted by H, which is a four-dimensional real vector space isomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^4$.",
        "A quaternion $X$ can be represented as $X = [a, (b, c, d)]$, where $a$ is the scalar part and $(b, c, d)$ is the vector part. The conjugate of $X$, denoted as $X^*$ or $\\overline{X}$, is defined as $X^* = [a, -(b, c, d)]$ or $X^* = a1 - bi - cj - dk$. The product of a quaternion and its conjugate, $XX^*$, results in a real number $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)$, which is a scalar. If $X$ is non-zero, it is invertible, and its inverse is given by $X^{-1} = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)^{-1}X^*$. The multiplicative inverse of a unit quaternion $q$ is its conjugate $\\overline{q}$.",
        "The real vector space su(2) consists of 2x2 skew-Hermitian matrices with zero trace, defined as $su(2) = \\left\\{ \\begin{pmatrix} iu_1 & u_2 + iu_3 \\\\ -u_2 + iu_3 & -iu_1 \\end{pmatrix} | (u_1, u_2, u_3) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3 \\right\\}$. For any matrix $A \\in su(2)$, $A^* = -A$ and $tr(A) = 0$.",
        "The adjoint representation of the group SU(2) is a group homomorphism Ad: SU(2) \\u2192 GL(su(2)) such that for every $q \\in SU(2)$, $Ad_q(A) = qAq^*$, where $A \\in su(2)$ and $q^*$ is the inverse of $q$. This map preserves Hermitian matrices with zero trace and is key to representing rotations in SO(3) using unit quaternions.",
        "A unit quaternion $q \\in SU(2)$ induces a map $r_q$ on $\\mathbb{R}^3$ defined by $r_q(x, y, z) = \\psi^{-1}(q \\varphi(x, y, z) q^*)$, where $\\varphi(x, y, z) = x\\sigma_3 + y\\sigma_2 + z\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_i$ are Pauli spin matrices. The map $r_q$ is a linear and orthogonal transformation, i.e., $r_q \\in O(3)$.",
        "The map $r: SU(2) \\rightarrow SO(3)$ is a surjective homomorphism with kernel $\\{I, -I\\}$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. This means that every rotation in SO(3) can be represented by a unit quaternion, and the representation is unique up to a sign. If $q = \\begin{pmatrix} a + ib & c + id \\\\ -(c - id) & a - ib \\end{pmatrix}$, the matrix representation of the rotation $r_q$ is given by $R_q = \\begin{pmatrix} a^2 + b^2 - c^2 - d^2 & 2bc + 2ad & 2ac - 2bd \\\\ 2bc - 2ad & a^2 - b^2 + c^2 - d^2 & -2ab - 2cd \\\\ -2ac - 2bd & 2ab - 2cd & a^2 - b^2 - c^2 + d^2 \\end{pmatrix}$.",
        "The exponential map exp: su(2) \\u2192 SU(2) is surjective, meaning every unit quaternion can be expressed as the exponential of a skew-Hermitian matrix with zero trace. This map is an analog of the exponential map exp: so(3) \\u2192 SO(3). For any matrix A \\u2208 su(2), $e^A$ = cos(\\u03b8)I + (sin(\\u03b8)/\\u03b8)A, where \\u03b8 = \\u221a(u\\u2081\\u00b2 + u\\u2082\\u00b2 + u\\u2083\\u00b2) and A involves the components u\\u2081, u\\u2082, u\\u2083.",
        "Quaternion interpolation, specifically the slerp (spherical linear interpolation) formula, provides a method for interpolating between two quaternions $q_1$ and $q_2$. The slerp formula is given by $slerp(q_1, q_2, t) = q_1 (q_1^{-1} q_2)^t$, where $t \\in [0, 1]$. The formula is also given by $slerp(q1, q2, t) = (sin((1-t)\\u03a9)/sin(\\u03a9))q1 + (sin(t\\u03a9)/sin(\\u03a9))q2, where cos(\\u03a9) = q1 \\u00b7 q2. This is used in computer graphics and robotics for smooth rotation interpolation.",
        "There is no continuous or homomorphic section $s: SO(3) \\rightarrow SU(2)$ of the homomorphism $r: SU(2) \\rightarrow SO(3)$. This implies that there is no \\\"nice\\\" way to consistently choose the sign of the quaternion representing a rotation."
