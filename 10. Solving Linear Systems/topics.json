        "A sequence of vectors (uk) in a normed vector space (E, || ||) converges to a limit u \u2208 E if, for every \u03b5 > 0, there exists a natural number N such that ||uk - u|| \u2264 \u03b5 for all k > N. This convergence is fundamental in analyzing the behavior of iterative methods. In finite-dimensional vector spaces, this convergence is equivalent to the convergence of the scalar sequences formed by the components of these vectors in any base, simplifying convergence analysis.",
        "A necessary and sufficient condition for the sequence (Bk) of powers of a matrix B to converge to the zero matrix is that the spectral radius \u03c1(B) of B is less than 1. The spectral radius \u03c1(B) of a matrix B is defined as the maximum of the moduli |\u03bb| of the eigenvalues of B, representing the maximum amplification factor applied to any eigenvector by the matrix. For a square matrix B, the following conditions are equivalent: (1) limk\u2192\u221e Bk = 0; (2) limk\u2192\u221e Bkv = 0, for all vectors v; (3) \u03c1(B) < 1; (4) ||B|| < 1, for some subordinate matrix norm || ||. These conditions are interconnected, where each condition implies and is implied by the others.",
        "For every square matrix B \u2208 Mn(C) and every matrix norm || ||, the limit of ||Bk||^(1/k) as k approaches infinity is equal to the spectral radius \u03c1(B), connecting matrix norms with spectral properties. For any \u03b5 > 0, there exists an integer N(\u03b5) such that ||Bk||^(1/k) < \u03c1(B) + \u03b5 for all k > N(\u03b5), meaning that the kth root norm of Bk approaches the spectral radius \u03c1(B) as k increases. This result is useful in analyzing convergence rates of iterative methods, where a matrix with a smaller spectral radius leads to faster convergence."

        "Iterative methods for solving a linear system Ax = b (with A \u2208 Mn(C) invertible) involve finding a matrix B and a vector c such that I - B is invertible, and the unique solution of Ax = b is equal to the unique solution of u = Bu + c. The sequence (uk) is computed iteratively from an initial vector u0 using the formula uk+1 = Buk + c. The iterative method converges if limk\u2192\u221e uk = \u0217 for every initial vector u0. This convergence is fundamentally linked to the properties of the matrix B.",
        "The error vector ek = uk - \u0217 quantifies the difference between the kth iterate and the true solution, where \u0217 is the unique solution of the system u = Bu + c. The iterative method converges if and only if limk\u2192\u221e ek = 0, where ek = Bke0, and e0 = u0 - \u0217. This allows the convergence of the iterative method to be analyzed in terms of the powers of the matrix B and the initial error vector. Asymptotically, the error vector ek = Bke0 behaves at worst like (\u03c1(B))^k, where \u03c1(B) is the spectral radius of B and e0 is the initial error vector, indicating that the spectral radius dictates the rate of convergence.",
        "A fundamental criterion for the convergence of iterative methods based on a matrix B is that the spectral radius of B, \u03c1(B), is less than 1. Given a system u = Bu + c, where I \u2013 B is invertible, the following statements are equivalent: (1) The iterative method converges; (2) \u03c1(B) < 1; (3) ||B|| < 1, for some subordinate matrix norm || ||. This provides a practical way to verify convergence using matrix norms. These conditions provide criteria for assessing convergence."

        "Iterative methods for solving a linear system Ax = b can be expressed as A = M - N, where M is invertible and 'easy to invert' (e.g., close to a diagonal or triangular matrix). The iterative scheme is then given by u = M^(-1)Nu + M^(-1)b, where M and N are chosen to ensure convergence and computational efficiency. Different methods correspond to different choices of M and N from A. The first two methods choose M and N as disjoint submatrices of A, while the relaxation method allows some overlap of M and N.",
        "To describe the various choices of M and N, it is convenient to write A in terms of three submatrices: D, E, and F, where D contains the diagonal entries, E contains the negatives of the nonzero entries below the diagonal, and F contains the negatives of the nonzero entries above the diagonal. This is represented as A = D - E - F.",
        "In Jacobi's method, it is assumed that all diagonal entries in A are nonzero, and M = D and N = E + F, leading to the Jacobi iteration matrix J = D^(-1)(E + F). The recurrence is uk+1 = D^(-1)(E + F)uk + D^(-1)b. The Gauss-Seidel method uses the new value uk+1 instead of uk in solving for subsequent components, leading to faster convergence. It is expressed as M = D - E and N = F, with the matrix B given by B = M^(-1)N = (D - E)^(-1)F, which is the Gauss-Seidel matrix L1. The relaxation method incorporates part of the matrix D into N, defining M = (D/\u03c9) - E and N = ((1 - \u03c9)/\u03c9)D + F, where \u03c9 is a real parameter chosen appropriately. The matrix B is denoted by L\u03c9 and called the matrix of relaxation. Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR) occurs when \u03c9 > 1.",
        "Each method involves solving a system of equations in each iteration. For example, in Jacobi's method, Duk+1 = (E + F)uk + b, and in Gauss-Seidel, (D - E)uk+1 = Fuk + b. Iteratively solving the systems Muk+1 = Nuk + b avoids explicit inversion of M. Different choices of M and N lead to different iterative schemes, each with its own convergence properties."

The Ostrowski-Reich theorem provides a sufficient condition for the convergence of the relaxation method, stating that if A = D - E - F is Hermitian positive definite and 0 < \u03c9 < 2, then the relaxation method converges. This theorem provides a sufficient condition for the convergence of relaxation methods.",
        "Without any assumption on A = D - E - F other than A and D being invertible, the relaxation method converges only if \u03c9 \u2208 (0, 2). This establishes a range for the relaxation parameter. The convergence results extend to block decompositions of A, where D, E, and F consist of blocks, and D is an invertible block-diagonal matrix.",

In special cases, Proposition 10.5 can be used to prove the convergence of Jacobi's method. Strict diagonal dominance ensures convergence for both Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods."

        "For tridiagonal matrices, precise results about the spectral radius of the Jacobi matrix J and the Gauss-Seidel matrix L1 can be obtained, leading to convergence insights. For a tridiagonal matrix A, the spectral radius of the Gauss-Seidel matrix is the square of the spectral radius of the Jacobi matrix, i.e., \u03c1(L1) = (\u03c1(J))^2. This relationship allows for a direct comparison of their convergence rates.",
        "The Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel methods either both converge or both diverge simultaneously for tridiagonal matrices. When they converge, Gauss-Seidel converges faster than Jacobi's method. For a tridiagonal Hermitian positive definite matrix, there exists a unique optimal relaxation parameter \u03c90 that minimizes the spectral radius of the relaxation matrix L\u03c9. This parameter is given by \u03c9o = 2 / (1 + \u221a(1 - (\u03c1(J))^2)).",
        "The Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and relaxation methods all converge for tridiagonal Hermitian positive definite matrices when \u03c9 \u2208 (0, 2). The eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix J are real, and specific formulas relate the eigenvalues of J and the roots of characteristic equations to convergence properties. For a tridiagonal Hermitian positive definite matrix, the convergence rates of the methods are related by \u03c1(L\u03c9o) < \u03c1(L1) = (\u03c1(J))^2 < \u03c1(J). This hierarchy shows that the relaxation method converges faster than Gauss-Seidel, which in turn converges faster than Jacobi."
