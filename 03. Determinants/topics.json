        "A permutation on n elements is defined as a bijection \u03c0: [n] \u2192 [n], where [n] represents the set {1, 2, ..., n}. This mapping rearranges the elements of the set, establishing a one-to-one correspondence between the elements and their new positions. When composing permutations, the terminology 'product of permutations' or 'product of transpositions' is used synonymously. Cauchy's two-line notation represents a permutation \u03c3 as a 2 \u00d7 n array, where the top row lists the elements [n] and the bottom row lists their images under \u03c3. One-line notation represents a permutation by its image sequence \u03c3(1) \u03c3(2) \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 \u03c3(n). These notations are useful for computational and combinatorial analysis of permutations. The set of all permutations on n elements forms a group under the operation of composition, known as the symmetric group Sn. This group has n! elements, corresponding to all possible arrangements of the n elements.",
        "A transposition is a specific type of permutation that involves swapping two distinct elements i and j within the set [n], while keeping all other elements unchanged. Formally, a transposition \u03c4: [n] \u2192 [n] satisfies \u03c4(i) = j, \u03c4(j) = i, and \u03c4(k) = k for all k \u2208 [n] - {i, j}. A cyclic permutation of order k, also known as a k-cycle, is a permutation \u03c3: [n] \u2192 [n] that cyclically shifts a sequence of k distinct elements (i1, i2, ..., ik) within the set [n], such that \u03c3(i1) = i2, \u03c3(i2) = i3, ..., \u03c3(ik-1) = ik, and \u03c3(ik) = i1, while leaving all other elements unchanged. The alternating group An is a subgroup of the symmetric group Sn consisting of all even permutations. The alternating group can be generated by 3-cycles.",
        "Every permutation on n elements can be expressed as a product (composition) of transpositions. While the decomposition into transpositions is not unique, the parity (evenness or oddness) of the number of transpositions required is an invariant property of the permutation.",
        "The signature of a permutation \u03c0, denoted as \u03b5(\u03c0), is a function that assigns a value of +1 if the permutation can be expressed as a product of an even number of transpositions, and -1 if it can be expressed as a product of an odd number of transpositions. This signature is an invariant property of the permutation and is independent of the specific decomposition into transpositions. The parity of the number of transpositions in a permutation is an invariant, meaning that any two decompositions of the same permutation into transpositions will have the same parity (either both even or both odd). The signature of a permutation \u03c0, denoted \u03b5(\u03c0), is defined as (-1)^{n-r}, where r is the number of disjoint cycles in the permutation's cycle decomposition. The signature \u03b5(\u03c0) is 1 if \u03c0 is an even permutation and -1 if \u03c0 is an odd permutation. The signature of a composition of permutations is the product of their signatures, i.e., \u03b5(\u03c0' \u25e6 \u03c0) = \u03b5(\u03c0')\u03b5(\u03c0). In particular, since \u03c0\u207b\u00b9 \u25e6 \u03c0 = id\u2099, we have \u03b5(\u03c0\u207b\u00b9) = \u03b5(\u03c0)."

Equivalently, an alternating map satisfies f(..., xi, xi+1, ...) = -f(..., xi+1, xi, ...), which means that swapping two adjacent arguments changes the sign of the function. Alternating multilinear maps satisfy crucial properties, including: swapping two arguments negates the result, f(..., xi, xi+1, ...) = \u2212f(..., xi+1, xi, ...); if two arguments are equal, the result is zero, f(..., xi, ..., xj, ...) = 0 when xi = xj; and adding a scalar multiple of one argument to another leaves the result unchanged, f(..., xi + \u03bbxj, ...) = f(..., xi, ...) for any \u03bb \u2208 K, where i \u2260 j.",
