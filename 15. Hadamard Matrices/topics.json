        "Haar matrices and wavelets are fundamental tools in signal processing and computer graphics, enabling the compression of long signals while retaining essential information. They involve matrices with specific structures and corresponding wavelet bases for representing signals. The Haar basis vectors are obtained by a 'scaling and shifting process' from the 'mother' wavelet w2, which involves generating new vectors by adjusting the scale and position of the original wavelet. The formal definition of the Haar basis vectors of dimension 2\\u207f (w\\u2081, h\\u2080\\u2070, h\\u2081\\u2070, ..., h\\u2096\\u02b2, ...) involves piecewise constant functions, indexed by j (escala) and k (posi\\u00e7\\u00e3o), allowing the construction of the Haar matrix W\\u2099. Faster algorithms for converting a vector u to a vector c of coefficients over the Haar basis involve averaging and differencing, rather than using W\\u207b\\u00b9 or W directly, improving computational efficiency.",
        "Hadamard matrices, characterized by elements of +1 or -1 and orthogonal columns, find applications in error correcting codes, signal processing, and low-rank approximation, offering unique properties for data manipulation. They satisfy HTH = nIn, where n is the dimension of the matrix. Sylvester's construction provides a recursive method for generating Hadamard matrices of dimension 2m for all m \\u2265 1, forming an infinite family of symmetric Hadamard matrices. Sylvester-Hadamard matrices (H2m) are utilized in algorithms for dimension reduction and low-rank matrix approximation, particularly through subsampled randomized Hadamard transforms (SRHT), which involve random diagonal signs, normalized Hadamard matrices, and random coordinate restrictions. The Hadamard conjecture states that for every positive integer of the form n = 4k, there is a Hadamard matrix of dimension n, which remains an open problem. Walsh functions are piecewise affine functions associated with the rows of Sylvester-Hadamard matrices, indexed by the number of sign changes between consecutive groups of +1 and -1.",
        "The change of basis matrix W, constructed from Haar basis vectors, transforms a vector from the canonical basis to the Haar basis, facilitating signal analysis and compression. The transformation of a signal v into its coefficients c over the Haar basis involves computing c = W\\u207b\\u00b9v, where W\\u207b\\u00b9 is the inverse of the Haar matrix, allowing for efficient signal representation. A faster way to find c = W\\u207b\\u00b9v, without actually using W\\u207b\\u00b9, is related to the multiscale nature of Haar wavelets, which involves computing averages and half differences. Signal reconstruction involves computing v = Wc, where discarding coefficients in c achieves compression, maintaining crucial signal information in the reconstructed signal v-hat. The coefficient c\\u2081 represents the overall average value of the signal v, corresponding to the background of an image or sound, providing a general approximation of the signal's content. The coefficients c\\u2082, c\\u2083, and c\\u2084 represent coarse details, details in the first part, and details in the second half of the signal v, respectively, capturing different levels of signal granularity.",
        "Multiresolution signal analysis using the Haar basis involves representing a signal u with Haar coefficients c, where low-index coefficients give coarse information and high-index coefficients give fine information, enabling signal compression. Exploiting the multiresolution feature of wavelets allows for signal compression by using fewer coefficients to represent the signal. The Haar transform provides a multiresolution analysis of a signal, where coefficients with low index give coarse information and high index coefficients represent fine details, useful for signal compression by using fewer coefficients. The 2D Haar transform generalizes to matrices for digital image compression, involving normalization of Haar coefficients using the orthogonal matrix Hn = WnDn, enabling efficient image representation and transmission. The Haar transform can be used to progressively transmit images over the internet, starting with coarse coefficients and gradually refining the details as more data is received."

        "Recursive construction of the Haar matrix W\\u2099 of dimension 2\\u207f clarifies why the columns of W\\u2099 are pairwise orthogonal, splitting W\\u2099 into two 2\\u207f \\u00d7 2\\u207f\\u207b\\u00b9 matrices.

        "The Haar transform can be generalized to matrices, even rectangular ones, for the compression of digital images, addressing the issue of normalization of the Haar coefficients. The 2\\u207f \\u00d7 2\\u207f matrix W\\u2099 of Haar basis vectors has orthogonal columns, but its columns do not have unit length, leading to the matrix W\\u2099\\u207b\\u00b9 = D\\u2099W\\u2099\\u1d40.
